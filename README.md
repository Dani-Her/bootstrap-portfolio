# Bootstrap portfolio
## Description
In this project I built a portfolio using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 
My main goals were 
- To make it responsive, if resized.
- To have a skills section.
- When the links in the navigation are clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
- The contact section to take user to the corresponding contact method.
